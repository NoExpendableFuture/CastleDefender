A LIGHT IN THE DARK (Working title)

----------------------------

Project initial scope - create a game in a week (maybe two - do still have to do the day job, cook, wash etc :/)

General idea - Zelda-ish game where the player avatar must fend off attacking enemies in a self contained level, and solve some (fairly simple) puzzles to get a special power orb that will activate, end the flow/respawning of enemies, then open level exit to complete the level

Visual style... maybe a bit like Crypt of the Necrodancer? top down, but a little from the front?

Needs:

Camera
---------
With ability to track a target (ie. player and the exit door when it disintegrates) and switch between the two when needed

Player 
------
Movement states - idle, walk, attack, run(? optional, maybe later) - try and make a nice generic state class for this to switch between them

Collision

Marked/Unmarked status (so enemy knows when to start pursuit)

Health meter

Attacks
	Melee - sword
	Range - spellcasting? Later.

Animations

Respawn mechanics

Terrain
-------

Tile based system for laying out new terrain... which to use? Inbuilt one should work, just make sure to set up as per this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDdKv0DgY5I

Sprites/animations for tiles

Enemies
------
Two enemy types to start:

One phantom that floats around freely (ignores terrain - bonus if it shows some animation going through the wall) to attack the player. When killed immediately revives at it's spawn point (some suitably creepy dimensional tear... thing)

And a skeleton enemy that walks around and is bound by level geometry same as the player. Once killed, will stay down for a period of time before reviving until orb is acquired

These will need the movement and attack systems used by player, plus some simple AI to point them straight to the player (for phantom) and guide via pathfinding (for skellys)

Allow player to move freely until first enemy encounter, then they'll be "marked" (maybe an effect at sides of the screen) and pursued until they get the orb

For each:
Health meter

Attacks

Animations

Respawn mechanics

Hazards
--------
Two types - Demon-Fire and spike panels

Fire causes DOT, Spikes a one-off damage


Level/Puzzles
-----

"Level ending" orb item and associated triggers/effects
	- Maybe a shader

Exit point - probably a door - maybe a really big solid/evil looking door player uses the item to blast through :D

Terrain to block the player

Doors player can open using triggers player can activate (whether via activate key - or maybe just attack them?)

Switches? Preferably activate via attack (so I don't have to implement another button... might do the same for level complete orb, could be kinda satisfying)

Block pushing puzzles?


Checkpoints
---------
Trigger points/zones across the level - add each to a list when player crosses them, most recent first.

When player dies, respawn at most recent checkpoint not currently threatened by an enemy


------------

And of course graphics and sound for all of the above :/

Player "marking"

Skellies

Demon-fire

Wall/Floor graphics

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Friday 28 Oct - Phantoms and player "marking"

Phantom enemy
	- Track and move to player: done
	- Stop before reaching player to allow multiple melee strikes: done
	- Hit player when in range (melee attack): done, but....
		- Feels like the attack is too sudden - might need enemy to pause and wind up a bit to give player a chance to get away, and a brief cooldown to allow counterattacking
		- Wind up: done
		- Cooldown: done
	- Damage player: done
	- Get hit by player melee attacks: done
	- Remove after killed: done
	- Respawn

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thursday 27 Oct - Phantoms
Was planning to add phantoms today, but no work done :( Partly bad sleep, partly slow days at work draining energy

Split player and base actor scripts: done

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed - skipped :/

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday 25 Oct - Hazards

Monday 24 Oct - Add level exit and orb
	- Yeah, might have been a bit optimistic here on initial planning. Having to remember how coroutines and Action worked slowed things down a bit. Most of the animation/polish stuff carried over :(
