A LIGHT IN THE DARK (Working title)

----------------------------

Project initial scope - create a game in a week (maybe two - do still have to do the day job, cook, wash etc :/)

General idea - Zelda-ish game where the player avatar must fend off attacking enemies in a self contained level, and solve some (fairly simple) puzzles to get a special power orb that will activate, end the flow/respawning of enemies, then open level exit to complete the level

Visual style... maybe a bit like Crypt of the Necrodancer? top down, but a little from the front?

Needs:

Camera
---------
With ability to track a target (ie. player and the exit door when it disintegrates) and switch between the two when needed

Player 
------
Movement states - idle, walk, run(? optional, maybe later), attack - try and make a nice generic state class for this to switch between them

Collision

Marked/Unmarked status (so enemy knows when to start pursuit)

Health meter

Attacks

Animations

Respawn mechanics

Terrain
-------

Tile based system for laying out new terrain... which to use? Inbuilt one should work, just make sure to set up as per this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDdKv0DgY5I

Sprites/animations for tiles

Enemies
------
Two enemy types to start:

One phantom that floats around freely (ignores terrain - bonus if it shows some animation going through the wall) to attack the player. When killed immediately revives at it's spawn point (some suitably creepy dimensional tear... thing)

And a skeleton enemy that walks around and is bound by level geometry same as the player. Once killed, will stay down for a period of time before reviving until orb is acquired

These will need the movement and attack systems used by player, plus some simple AI to point them straight to the player (for phantom) and guide via pathfinding (for skellys)

Allow player to move freely until first enemy encounter, then they'll be "marked" (maybe an effect at sides of the screen) and pursued until they get the orb

For each:
Health meter

Attacks

Animations

Respawn mechanics


Level/Puzzles
-----

"Level ending" orb item and associated triggers/effects
	- Maybe a shader

Exit point - probably a door - maybe a really big solid/evil looking door player uses the item to blast through :D

Terrain to block the player

Doors player can open using triggers player can activate (whether via activate key - or maybe just attack them?)

Switches? Preferably activate via attack (so I don't have to implement another button... might do the same for level complete orb, could be kinda satisfying)

Block pushing puzzles?

Hazards

Checkpoints
---------
Trigger points/zones across the level - add each to a list when player crosses them, most recent first.

When player dies, respawn at most recent checkpoint not currently threatened by an enemy


------------

And of course graphics and sound for all of the above :/

Sunday 23 Oct - setup and prep

Create a git repo: done

Create a Unity Project: done

Draft up todo tasks, timetable and brainstorm what to put in this thing: in progress

Player and movement states: not started

Player with movement and terrain to move around (blocking only - no sprites yet)
