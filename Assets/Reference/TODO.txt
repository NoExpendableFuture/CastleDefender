A LIGHT IN THE DARK (Working title)

----------------------------

Project initial scope - create a game in a week (maybe two - do still have to do the day job, cook, wash etc :/)
	- Sort of accomplished, albeit missing a lot of art assets :/
	
General idea - Zelda-ish game where the player avatar must fend off attacking enemies in a self contained level, and solve some (fairly simple) puzzles to get a special power orb that will activate, end the flow/respawning of enemies, then open level exit to complete the level

Visual style... maybe a bit like Crypt of the Necrodancer? top down, but a little from the front?

Needs:

Camera
---------
With ability to track a target (ie. player and the exit door when it disintegrates) and switch between the two when needed

Player 
------
Movement states - idle, walk, attack, run(? optional, maybe later) - try and make a nice generic state class for this to switch between them

Collision

Marked/Unmarked status (so enemy knows when to start pursuit)

Health meter

Attacks
	Melee - sword
	Range - spellcasting? Later.

Animations

Respawn mechanics

Terrain
-------

Tile based system for laying out new terrain... which to use? Inbuilt one should work, just make sure to set up as per this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDdKv0DgY5I

Sprites/animations for tiles

Enemies
------
Two enemy types to start:

One phantom that floats around freely (ignores terrain - bonus if it shows some animation going through the wall) to attack the player. When killed immediately revives at it's spawn point (some suitably creepy dimensional tear... thing)

And a skeleton enemy that walks around and is bound by level geometry same as the player. Once killed, will stay down for a period of time before reviving until orb is acquired

These will need the movement and attack systems used by player, plus some simple AI to point them straight to the player (for phantom) and guide via pathfinding (for skellys)

Allow player to move freely until first enemy encounter, then they'll be "marked" (maybe an effect at sides of the screen) and pursued until they get the orb

For each:
Health meter

Attacks

Animations

Respawn mechanics

Hazards
--------
Two types - Demon-Fire and spike panels

Fire causes DOT, Spikes a one-off damage


Level/Puzzles
-----

"Level ending" orb item and associated triggers/effects
	- Maybe a shader

Exit point - probably a door - maybe a really big solid/evil looking door player uses the item to blast through :D

Terrain to block the player

Doors player can open using triggers player can activate (whether via activate key - or maybe just attack them?)

Switches? Preferably activate via attack (so I don't have to implement another button... might do the same for level complete orb, could be kinda satisfying)

Block pushing puzzles?


Checkpoints
---------
Trigger points/zones across the level - add each to a list when player crosses them, most recent first.

When player dies, respawn at most recent checkpoint not currently threatened by an enemy


------------

And of course graphics and sound for all of the above :/

Timetable

----------------------------
Overflow/TODO list

Any overflow from previous days goes here

Block pushing/puzzles: in progress
	Determining if push happening: done
	Block movement: done
	Bug fix: Prevent block being pushed inside terrain...: done
	Player push state: in progress
	- ADD COLLISION MASK FOR BLOCK! ALSO - LAYERS FOR OBJECTS!

Sound!
		
End door 
	- improve graphix
	- fade out animation

Orb
	- Change graphic to look more like "light trapped inside a dark container": done
	- Floating effect: added, could improve further
	- Glow effect with "pulsing": added, could improve further
	- Shatter effect across screen: not started
	- Zoom to door opening then back after shatter: not started

Player "Sword Overcharge":
	Maybe also change player sword so it deals much more physical damage when "Charged" and after hitting something player can't use it to destroy enemies for a while (or just reduced damage), so they can bat them away but not remove them entirely... should make for larger, scarier hordes

Exit lighting - make sprite additive with layers below (or just make some sprite with it pre-baked on floor texture)
	
Skellies

Demon-fire

Wall/Floor graphics

UI
	- Health display with hearts: not started
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Saturday 5 Nov (and on for a while) - Actor animation continued

Think it's fair to say animating this stuff is not the bit I look forward to :/

Player
	- facing animation
	- attack animation
	- hurt/kill/invincibility frames animation
	- ded animation
	- hurt animation
	- Sword animation - more oomph at the end?

Phantom
	- Facing animations
	- movement animation
	- death animation
	- attack animation
	- swipe animation: done
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Friday 4 Nov - Animation

Player
	- Actor animation controller
		- Done - needed quite a bit of fiddling with the transitions to make it ok with interrupting animation :(
	- Observed bug - randomly see the player and enemy speed increase to ludicrous speed?!!
		- Fixed (I think) - moved movement stuff on actors to "FixedUpdate"
	- facing animation!
	- attack animation
	- hurt/kill/invincibility frames animation
	- Sword animation - more oomph at the end?
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

More days skipped - sleep patterns and/or lazy :(

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday 1 Nov - Misc.
	
Knockback and multiple-hit to kill phantoms: done

	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monday 31 Oct - Skipped :(

Stupid busted sleeping patterns. Making it real hard to work on this thing when I've no idea how long I'll be awake :(

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sunday 30 Oct - less work done than hoped :(

Phantom Respawns: done

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Saturday 29 Oct - Skipped :(

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Friday 28 Oct - Phantoms and player "marking"
	- Got most of it done Saturday morning - respawn moved to next day
	
Phantom enemy
	- Track and move to player: done
	- Stop before reaching player to allow multiple melee strikes: done
	- Hit player when in range (melee attack): done, but....
		- Feels like the attack is too sudden - might need enemy to pause and wind up a bit to give player a chance to get away, and a brief cooldown to allow counterattacking
		- Wind up: done
		- Cooldown: done
	- Damage player: done
	- Get hit by player melee attacks: done
	- Remove after killed: done

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thursday 27 Oct - Phantoms
Was planning to add phantoms today, but no work done :( Partly bad sleep, partly slow days at work draining energy

Split player and base actor scripts: done

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed - skipped :/

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday 25 Oct - Hazards
	- was an abridged day... so sleepy... woke up early

Player attack - make sword "swing": done in wee hours of the morning :D
	
Player health, game over state and respawning

	- Kill player if out of health: done

Spikes: in progress
	- apply injury to player when walking over: done
	- Animate: done

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monday 24 Oct - Add level exit and orb
	- Yeah, might have been a bit optimistic here on initial planning. Having to remember how coroutines and Action worked slowed things down a bit. Most of the animation/polish stuff carried over :(

	- Level restart: done
	
End door
	- Basic graphics: done
